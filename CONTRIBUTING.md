# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repository is a **coordination hub** and a satellite of `hyperpolymath/standards`: it does not own the K9 contractile specification or governance — those are pinned from `standards` — but it owns the conformance fixtures, the membership manifest, and the cross-repo drift CI. Human-readable documentation lives in the root; machine-readable metadata lives under `.machine_readable/`.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in many forms:

- **Conformance fixtures:** Add or refine `.k9.ncl` cases under `conformance/valid/` and `conformance/invalid/` (keep `conformance/manifest.a2ml` in sync).
- **Membership:** Propose member additions/removals via `.machine_readable/6a2/ECOSYSTEM.a2ml`, kept in lockstep with `.gitmodules` and `scripts/check-membership.sh`.
- **Drift CI & tooling:** Improve `.github/workflows/anchor-drift.yml` or the helper `scripts/`.
- **Documentation:** Enhance the docs or the AI manifest.
- **Bug reports:** File clear, reproducible issues.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the AI Manifest:** Start with `0-AI-MANIFEST.a2ml` to understand the repository structure.
2. **Initialise members:** Run `scripts/init-submodules.sh` to populate `members/` (each member is pinned by commit).
3. **Check membership:** Run `scripts/check-membership.sh` to verify the manifest, `.gitmodules`, and submodule declarations agree.
4. **Validate conformance:** Run the K9 validator (`hyperpolymath/k9-validate-action`) over `conformance/valid` (expect 0 errors) and over `conformance/invalid` with strict mode (every case must error).
